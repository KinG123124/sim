    "prompt": "Generate high-quality, realistic footsteps sounds of a human walking on asphalt. The sounds should be clear, rhythmic, and vary slightly in pitch and intensity to mimic natural movement. Include different step textures (e.g., heel-to-toe, light scuffs) for variety. The audio should be loop-friendly for game use (no abrupt cuts) and provided in stereo WAV format (44.1kHz, 16-bit). Optionally, add subtle environmental context (e.g., distant traffic, wind) but keep focus on the footsteps.",
